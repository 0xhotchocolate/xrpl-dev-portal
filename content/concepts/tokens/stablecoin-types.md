# Stablecoin Types

There are five common types of stablecoin traded on the XRP Ledger.

## Fiat Backed

Fiat-backed stablecoins are based on an existing currency such as EUR, USD, YEN, and so on. They are backed at an exchange rate of 1:1. It is a simple, stable option, but it is more centralized and susceptible to hacking.

## Crypto Backed

Crypto-backed stablecoins are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins, but set aside a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. It's decentralized, doesn't require a custodian or audits and regulation. It's also more volatile, and reliant on the stability of the underlying cryptocurrency.

## Commodity Backed

Commodity-backed stablecoins are based on a fungible asset such as gold, real estate, oil,  or electricity. Commodities are relatively stable and liquid, but are centralized and require regular audits to verify their value.

## Financial Instrument Backed

A stablecoin can be backed by financial instruments such as bonds or equity shares.

## Non-collateralized

A non-collateralized stablecoin relies on algorithm-generated smart contracts to supply or sell tokens, similar to a central bank's approach to printing and destroying currency. No collateral is required to mint currency. Value is controlled by supply and demand through algorithms that stabilize the price. Non-collateralized stablecoins are a less popular option due to their volatility.
