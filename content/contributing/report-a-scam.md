# Report a Scam
If you've been scammed, make sure to collect as much information as you can about the scam and scammer as soon as possible!

**Caution:** Please be aware that _no one_ can freeze accounts or revert transactions on the ledger. This is a consequence of the censorship-resistant design of the XRP Ledger blockchain.

1. Submit the scammer's wallet address to [Xrplorer's forensics team](https://xrplorer.com/forensics/submit).
2. Report your case to your local law enforcement. If the scammer is caught, this may allow you to get your money back.
3. If the scammer sent XRP to an exchange, be sure to contact the exchange's support team. The exchange can freeze the scammer's account at the exchange. Here are support links for a few popular exchanges:

    - [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support)
    - [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/)
    - [Uphold](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
    - [Bitrue](https://www.bitrue.com/exchange-web/footer/contactus.html)

4. If the scammer exchanged XRP for another token on the XRP Ledger, contact the token's issuer. The issuer may be able to [freeze the scammer's trust line](freeze-a-trust-line.html) to prevent the scammer from sending those tokens to others.
