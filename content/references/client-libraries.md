# Client Libraries

These client libraries simplify some of the common work of accessing and processing XRP Ledger data, and present it in a form that matches with the native conventions of their respective programming languages.

For other programming languages, you can access the XRP Ledger through the [HTTP APIs](http-websocket-apis.html).
