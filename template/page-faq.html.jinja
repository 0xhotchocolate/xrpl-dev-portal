         No, the XRP Ledger is a decentralized, public blockchain. Any changes that would impact transaction processing or consensus need to be approved by at least 80% of the network. Ripple is a contributor to the network, but its rights are the same as those of other contributors. In terms of validation, there are 38 validators, with Ripple running six of the 38.

        Proof of Work (PoW) was the first mechanism to solve the double spend problem without requiring a trusted 3rd party. However the XRP Ledger’s consensus mechanism solves the same problem in a far faster, cheaper and more energy efficient way.

        It’s been widely reported that Bitcoin’s energy consumption, as of 2021, is equivalent to that used by Argentina, with much of the electricity Bitcoin miners use coming from polluting sources. The XRP Ledger confirms transactions through a “<a href="/intro-to-consensus.html">consensus</a>” mechanism - which does not waste energy like proof of work does - and leverages carbon offsets to be one of the first truly <a href="https://ripple.com/ripple-press/ripple-leads-sustainability-agenda-to-achieve-carbon-neutrality-by-2030/" target="_blank">carbon neutral blockchains</a>.

        Yes, the XRP Ledger was built specifically to be able to tokenize arbitrary assets, e.g. USD, EUR, Oil, Gold, reward points, etc. Any currency can be issued on the XRP Ledger. This is illustrated by XRPL’s growing community that backs a variety of fiat and crypto tokens.

        Validators determine if transactions meet protocol requirements, and are therefore “valid.” The service validators uniquely provide is administratively grouping transactions into ordered units, agreeing on one such ordering specifically to prevent double spending.
        See Consensus and the Ripple Labs Tech Talk: Understanding Consensus for more information about the consensus process.

        They are the lists of validators a given participant believes will not conspire to defraud them. Each server operator can choose their own UNL, usually based on a default set provided by a trusted publisher.

      </h3>
      <p id="b4" class="collapse mt-3 mb-0" aria-labelledby="b4" data-parent="#faqs-accordian-2">
        Since anybody can run a validator, the burden is on the network participants to choose a reliable set. Currently, three publishers (Ripple, the XRP Ledger Foundation, and Coil) are known to publish recommended default lists of high quality validators, based on past performance, proven identities, and responsible IT policies.  However, every network participant can choose which validators it chooses as reliable and need not follow one of the three publishers noted above.

      </h3>
      <p id="b5" class="collapse mt-3 mb-0" aria-labelledby="b5" data-parent="#faqs-accordian-2">
        No. The XRP Ledger network is opt-in. Each participant directly or indirectly chooses its UNL. If Ripple stops operating or acts maliciously, participants can change their UNLs to use a list from a different publisher.

      </h3>
      <p id="b6" class="collapse mt-3 mb-0" aria-labelledby="b6" data-parent="#faqs-accordian-2">
        The primary incentive to run a validator is to preserve and protect the stable operation and sensible evolution of the network. It is the validators who decide the evolution of the XRP Ledger, so any business that uses or depends on the XRP Ledger has an inherent incentive to ensure the reliability, and stability of the network. Validators also earn the respect and goodwill of the community by contributing this way.
        <br/><br/>
        If you run an XRP Ledger server to participate in the network, the additional cost and effort to run a validator is minimal. This means that additional incentives, such as the mining rewards in Bitcoin, are not necessary. Ripple avoids paying XRP as a reward for operating a validator so that such incentives do not warp the behavior of validators.

      </h3>
      <p id="b7" class="collapse mt-3 mb-0" aria-labelledby="b7" data-parent="#faqs-accordian-2">
        No, institutions cannot set up customized validator policies for choosing to allow some transactions and reject others. Validators either follow the protocol, or they do not. If software does not follow protocol rules, it does not function. Thus, it is not recommended that institutions seek out custom implementations without in-house expertise.

      </h3>
      <p id="b8" class="collapse mt-3 mb-0" aria-labelledby="b8" data-parent="#faqs-accordian-2">
        Normally, if there is a dispute about the validity of one transaction, that transaction gets pushed back until the majority can come to an agreement. But if more than 20% of the network did not follow the same protocol rules as the majority, the network would temporarily halt. It could resume when participants reconfigure their UNLs based on those who want to reach consensus with each other. This temporary processing delay is desired rather than double spending.
        <br/><br/>
        In the process of determining the authoritative version of a ledger, there may be multiple temporary internal versions. Such internal versions naturally happen in distributed systems because not all nodes receive transactions in the same order. The analogous behavior in Bitcoin is where two servers each see a different longest chain because two blocks were mined at about the same time.
        <br/><br/>
        However, there can be only one latest validated ledger version at any given time; other versions are irrelevant and harmless.

      </h3>
      <p id="b9" class="collapse mt-3 mb-0" aria-labelledby="b9" data-parent="#faqs-accordian-2">
        No, a formal process for adding validators is not compatible with the XRP Ledger, because it is a system with no central authority.

        Ripple does publish a reference implementation of the core XRP Ledger server (rippled) and employs a team of engineers who contribute to the open-source codebase. Ripple also periodically publishes pre-compiled binary packages of the software as a convenience. Anyone is free to download and compile the software from source, if they prefer.
        <br/><br/>
        That being said, you don't need to use Ripple’s version of the XRP Ledger software to interact with the XRP Ledger. rippled is open-source software and Ripple grants anyone the ability to use, extend, and modify it as long as they follow the terms of the ISC license. The ISC License is very permissive compared to some other open-source licenses that strictly limit how you can extend and adapt the software.

The XRP Ledger also offers pre-built binary packages for CentOS, RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Debian Linux. Those packages are digitally signed by Ripple so that they are tamper-evident and their authenticity can be verified. Lastly, release bulletins are made available over a secure website, and include the commit ID of the repository, as well as the cryptographic hash values of the packages that are published.
